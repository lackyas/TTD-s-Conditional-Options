# Conditional Tweaks

Lets the user change game settings based on the character's state.
Do you want to keep you weapon out in dungeons?
Do you want BGM to always be on for cutscenes?
Do you want the world to turn purple when you jump?

Then this is the plugin for you!

In fact here are the rules you'll need for that last thing (copy and import them one at a time).

> Rule(Miounne's standard directive | AccessibilityColorBlindFilterEnable 1/0 conditions({Jumping, True} ))
> Rule(Kan-E-Senna's shoddy golden rule | AccessibilityColorBlindFilterType 3/0 conditions({Jumping, True} ))
